# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

* This is a TEAM Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone**.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files would be interpreted/compiled on ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files must end in a New Line
* Team Member: Lawrence Maduabuchi & Abdullahi Ngui.
* Date: August 7th 2023
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')

## Python Unit Tests
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ` 0. README, AUTHORS` | README.md, AUTHORS.|
| ` 1. Be pycodestyle compliant!` | Prints a char.|
| ` functions1.c` | Prints an unsigned number|
| ` functions2.c` | Prints the value of a pointer variable|
| ` get_flags.c` | Write a function calculate active flags.|
| ` get_precision.c` | Calculates the precision for printing |
| ` get_size.c` | Calculates the size to cast the argument |
| ` get_width.c` | Calculates the width for printing |
| ` handlr_print.c` | Prints an argument based on its type |
| ` main.h` | source file for all executable prototypes for program|
| ` utils.c` | A function that evaluates if a char is printable|
| ` write_handlers.c` | A function that explicitly prints a string |
